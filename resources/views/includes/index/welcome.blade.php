  <p class="mt-4">
    The Valdosta State University Chapter of The Delta Chi Fraternity was
    established in 1968 as one of the first fraternities on campus. Our
    Brotherhood celebrates hard work, a commitment to excellence, and the
    camaraderie found through shared, common values:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>FRIENDSHIP. CHARACTER. JUSTICE. EDUCATION.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Our Chapter is involved in many activities surrounding the University and
    our local community. We are involved in multiple philanthropic organizations,
    University intramural sports, fraternity and sorority greek life events,
    and have a strong network of alumni locally and in the Metro-Atlanta area
    that can support you in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    Simply put, being a Delta Chi at Valdosta State University means you are
    going to have the resources and opportunities to be more successful in life.
