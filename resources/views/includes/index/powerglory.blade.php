        The Delta Chi Fraternity was founded in 1890 at Cornell University in
        Ithaca, NY. The fraternity was originally founded as the second law
        fraternity on the Cornell campus after a few different groups of men
        joined together to form the organization. We, the members of The Delta
        Chi Fraternity, believe that great advantages are to be derived from a
        brotherhood of college and university men and appreciate that close
        association may promote friendship, develop character, advance justice,
        and assist in the acquisition of a sound education.
