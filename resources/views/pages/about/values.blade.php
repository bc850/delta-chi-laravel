            <h3>Preamble</h3>
            <p>
              "We, the members of The Delta Chi Fraternity, believing that
              great advantages are to be derived from a brotherhood of college
              and university men, appreciating that close association may promote
              friendship, develop character, advance justice, and assist in the
              acquisition of a sound education, do ordain and establish this
              Constitution."
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="py-3">
            <p>
              Certainly the most public and perhaps the best-known description
              of the purposes of Delta Chi, the Preamble's principle ideals offer
              profound potential as a guide to daily life as a brother.
            </p>
            <p>
              It has been pointed out that the four most important words in the
              Preamble are not what most members assume: "Friendship",
              "Character", "Justice", and "Education." Instead, it is suggested
              that the four most important words are "Promote", "Develop",
              "Advance", and "Assist." The point is that "Fraternity" and, in
              particular, "Delta Chi" is not just about what "is" but what we,
              as members, should actually be doing. It is our actions that make
              Delta Chi, which is why the key words are the verbs instead of
              the nouns.

              <h4>Promoting Friendship</h4>

              <p class="card-text">
                The friendships formed during your undergraduate years are
                relationships that will last far beyond graduation. Delta Chi
                was founded on the principle of bringing together men of similar
                interests to work towards a common good. This doesn't mean that
                men in a particular chapter are just clones of one another, but
                rather that the common bond of personal development through
                brotherhood can motivate a group of men to accomplish great things.
                This close association of college and university men produces
                life-long friends.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                Many of our members tell stories in which the groomsmen who stood
                next to them at their weddings were fraternity brothers.
                Reunions bring men from various generations to tears of laughter
                at the retelling of old stories. The experience of seeing your
                own son initiated into Delta Chi decades after you were can
                bring generations closer together through the shared experience
                of our Ritual.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                There is a silly stereotype that fraternity men just buy their
                friends. One of the best responses to this stereotype is that,
                "If I paid for my friends by joining my fraternity, then I
                surely did not pay enough for the caliber of friends I received."
                Delta Chi exists to promote friendship in its members.

                Character is good sportsmanship. Character is academic success
                and integrity. Character is holding yourself and others to a
                higher standard. Character is doing the right thing. The
                character of a man is the greatest measure of his potential. In
                Delta Chi, character is a core value and the cornerstone of
                the Fraternity.

                member who lives according to the values of the Ritual and the
                Eleven Basic Expectations all work to help develop your individual
                character.

                Originally founded as a law fraternity, Delta Chi still holds as
                its cardinal principle: the perpetuation of justice in society.
                A Delta Chi is always concerned with doing the right thing, even
                when it might not be the popular thing to do. This is an everyday
                value that all men should practice and a value that, as a member
                of Delta Chi, you will be expected to live.

                The reason you chose to go to college was to get an education.
                Delta Chi helps you make that happen.

                Going from high school to college is a stressful life change,
                and whatever you can do to make it less stressful, the better.
                To increase the odds of becoming academically successful, Delta
                Chi can provide you with a support network around your college
                experience. This can be in the form of study groups, note files,
                mentoring by upperclassmen, and advice from the chapter's faculty
                advisor. There is a reason that fraternity men have a higher
                graduation rate than men who choose not to join a fraternity.
                Success breeds success.

                In addition to the undergraduate services, the Educational
                Foundation provides members with scholarship opportunities
                based on academic success and campus involvement. If you're
                looking for academic support and success, Delta Chi can provide
                that. Delta Chi exists to assist in the acquisition of a sound
                education for its members.
